Welcome to Jeremy Domingos's GitHub Page! 

About Me

I'm currently studying software development through CS50, with a focus on low level systems, robotics and their application in real world senrios. 
I enjoy building things and exploring new technologies. This GitHub repository serves as a portfolio of my projects and contributions.

CS50

I'm currently enrolled in CS50, Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science. I'm excited to showcase all the mind binding projects my unhinged imagination comes up with.
